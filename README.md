# Team 7200's Robot Code

A command-based robot.

## Important Info

This branch is highly experimental as I try to get the bot working again on 2021 code.

Come January I'll have to update it to 2022 because FIRST likes it's yearly updates.

By then I want both the bots to be playing nice with this branch of code.

Good god there's a lot to document and learn
